# aimshoot
Target training mini-game / mouse accuracy exercise

## Build
To prepare for building, you need to have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Then, on the project root folder, run once:
```
npm install
```

After prepared, just run the following command to build:
```
npm run build
```
This will create the folder ```./dist``` with all the compiled/minified & ready to distribute files. You can open then the file ```./dist/aimshoot.html``` on the browser.

## Dependencies
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org): Framework for assembling the interface/menus.

* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node.js packet manager - to install webpack + dependencies and run build commands.
